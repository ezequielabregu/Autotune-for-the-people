# Autotune for people

A simple, free Autotune web app implemented in Flask &amp; Python.

Pitch correction effects are used to tune signals that are slightly out of key.\
Perhaps the most useful on vocal tracks, but can be used on anything!

cd Autotune4people
pip install -r requirements.txt
python app.py
